# Alpha-Beta and Min-Max prunning algorithms in JAVA

## Tik Tak Toe
This is an implementation of the AlphaBet and MinMax algorithms applied to **_Tik Tak Toe_**

The implmentation is interactive, thus you may play against the computer.

You may choose the algorithm that the computer player uses:

* MinMax
* AlphaBeta

The size of the search space and searching time is displayed during the game.

### Usage
1. Compile `.java` files
2. Run _TikTakToe_
3. Choose an algorithm: `1` if `MinMax`, `2` if `AlphaBeta`
4. Choose if you want to be the first to play: `1`if `Yes`, `any other int` if `No`
5. Play, choose cell: `row` and `column` index, seperated by space. _Example: `0 0` plays on first row first column_
